Some people really needed a shoulder to lean on or a buddy and doing this project was helpful in giving them that.","The most significant moment was when we had all of the students sign a pledge to be the change. Seeing all those kids swarmed around me signing their names with flourish as a way to let everyone know that they stand against bullying really gave me hope that things can and will get better.","The amount of support we got from everyone.

I fully expected a lack luster turnout for most of our events because before the event not many students seemed excited but when it came down to it lots of students showed up in support, decorating doors, dressing up and participating in all of our activities.","","Indifference- an original song by Elizabeth Diedrick","I will remember the overwhelming feeling of doing something good for someone else that I got when I talked to people who needed help working through hard times or who have been through bullying situations.","I learned that you can't always know who needs help and who doesn't. I also learned that there is always more you can do to show your support and help those in need.","","What were you feeling when you watched so many people sign the pledge?","","16 hours","26 hours","The only thing I might request improving is a modification to the philanthropy project website, that allows for impact campaigns (no funds raised) to be entered and edited more simply.
