The most important one was raising my fundraising target and exceeding it. I was optimistic about my campaign and had a great start but as I got closer to reaching the fundraising target I began to run out of people to ask for support(so I thought). I had asked all my teachers and Facebook friends and a highlight of my campaign was seeing the people who I did not expect to donate to my campaign actually donate. For example, my friend Daisey Navarrete donated $30 to my campaign and I was completely shocked and happy at the same time because one, I didn't expect student donations, and two, because I realized that it was going to get support from people who I least expected.","","I think the first day of my campaign surprised me the most. It had only been hours after my campaign and I already had a little over $100 in donations. It shouldn't have been a suprised because I had asked the AO team but I was and that's when it clicked that I had to continue the momentum and that it would be possible to raise the $500.","","","In five years the expiernece will probably still be fresh in my mind however, I will always remember the generosity I received. I will defiantly remember that when I am asked for a donation by anyone.","During this experience  I learned about the power of communication. In order to get the donations I did all I had to do was communicate. I would send emails asking for donations and it worked. The video I made was also another communicating tool and it helped substantially. I was the type of person who was sort of lazy when it came to emailing, especially responding, but now I know I cannot procrastinate a response because it could mean an end to a converse.","","I wish someone could ask me if it possible to have a successful campaign on the Philanthropy Project and I would say it is but you have to try your best to promote it. There will be time where you have momentum and others where you will be at a stall. There will be times where you think you don't have anyone else to ask for support and times where you might get down because of a no, but as long as you continue spreading the word about your campaign, then the better the chance that someone will donate. ","","15 hours","2","It was really easy to get my campaign started and I liked that a lot. I feel like anyone can start a campaign, and that's good. Although there were many questions, I acknowledge that all the questions were important so that I could share as much information to a potential donor. Some of the questions were kind of hard to understand but the sample answers definently helped a lot. I defiantly liked the helped from Kevin because he was able to edit a few of my mistakes and polish my campaign description.

I absolutely loved everything about the Philanthropy Project and the only thing I would add to this website is an option to have a separate page where information about one's campaign is located, a page where information about donating is not located. I mean this not to hide anything, but I ran into situations where I had to submit a website for my organization during donation requests and I wish I could've directed them to a website with my organization's info. For example, when asking for equipment requests I thought it was weird to ask for a donation when I already had a campaign where I was raising money to get equipment; I thought the donor would think that they shouldn't donate equipment because I was already going to have money to buy some. ","Thank you Kevin and Brooke. I'm so glad I met you guys at the raise a class event, I mean what a coincidence, right.","5","","http://philanthropyproject.com/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/amazon.png,http://philanthropyproject.com/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/gopherreciept.png","",""
