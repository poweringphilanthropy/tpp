","A very significant moment for me was when I reached $1000. It was just a surreal moment and that's when it actually hit me that what I am doing is making a change. ","It was really surprising to me to see that people can be so generous and that anyone no matter how young can change the world. ","","I don't really know what my theme song would be. Maybe who let the dogs out?","In five years when I look back on this experience I will remember that I was almost 13 and I did such a great thing. ","I learned that the worst someone can say is no and that anything is possible. ","I raised over $1000 and I made a difference in people's and animal's lives. ","I wish that someone would ask me if they could do this, and if someone saw me as an inspiration to do something great. ","I am going to take on the challenges that come at me and I will always be a philanthropist. I hope to do something like this again in the near future. ","Putting it all together I would say 1-2 hours at most. ","My event was 2 hours so there's that and there were other mechanics so maybe 5 hours in total. ","I really loved that there was a place I could track my progress and one place people could find anything about the project. I can't think of anything for you to improve. ","This was a really fantastic experience and I hope everyone gets the chance to do something like this.  Thank you!","5","","","",""
